# Mario.AI 

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for setting up and running a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to play Super Mario Bros using OpenAI Gym and the `gym_super_mario_bros` environment.


## Features

- Uses `gym_super_mario_bros` for game simulation.

- Implements `JoypadSpace` to simplify movement controls.

- Uses `Proximal policy optimization (PPO)` an reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for training an intelligent agent.

  
## Training Progress

Below are two videos demonstrating how Mario improves as the number of training steps increases:
